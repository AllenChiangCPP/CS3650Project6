# CS3650Project6
**Overview**<br>
Java program that is an assembler that translates programs written in in Hack assembly language to binary code. Results printed to new .hack files and command line.


**Dependencies**<br>
This project uses the following libraries:
BufferedReader <br>
FileReader <br>
IOException <br>
HashMap <br>
Map <br>
BufferedWriter <br>
File <br>
FileWriter

**Results**<br>
The results Assembler.java printed in command line and in .hack files

**Note**<br>
          -Code and run tests were done on Visual Studio Code and the command prompt.


**Usage**<br>
          -Compiling: Type "javac -d testing  assembler/Assembler.java" outside the assembler folder in the command line to compile Assembler.java as Assembler.class. Assembler.class is in the testing folder for testing with given assembly files.<br>
          <sub>-Compiling ex: "C:\Users\name\Desktop\nand2tetris\nand2tetris\nand2tetris\projects\06>javac -d testing Assembler/Assembler.java"</sub> <br> <br>
          -Running: Go into the testing folder and run the command "java Assembler <.asm file here>" (ex: java Assembler Add.asm)in the command line. Running the code outputs a hack file sharing the same name as the given assembly file with "JAVA" after the assembly file name and the translated assembly code to the command line. <br>
          <sub>-Running ex: "C:\Users\name\Desktop\nand2tetris\nand2tetris\nand2tetris\projects\06\testing>java Assembler Add.asm"</sub>
